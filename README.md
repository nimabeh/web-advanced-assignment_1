## Project
Here is the code for the first project of web development using Sass.


## Credits

The `_reset.scss` file (modified somewhat) is culled from Eric Meyer’s reset document, found at [`http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/`](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). The simple grid syntax in `_grid.scss` is a modification of CodePen user Arvin Quilao’s [example](http://codepen.io/arvinquilao/pen/IbwaA), which, in turn, is derived from GitHub user MikeAM’s [Gist example](https://gist.github.com/MikeAM/5171527#file-baseline-grid-css).

The font used in this example is [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans), licensed under the [SIF OFL](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL_web).
